## `Project Overview ` <br/>
In this analysis, I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, I submitted a written report that created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. <br/>

## `Summary`

1.	A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type above shows following:  <br/>
•	The total number of rides for Urban city type is 1625. <br/>
•	The total number of rides for Suburban city type is 625.  <br/>
•	The total number of rides for Rural city type is 125.  <br/>
•	The total number of drivers for Urban city type is 2405.  <br/>
•	The total number of drivers for Suburban city type is 490. <br/>
•	The total number of drivers for Rural city type is 78. <br/>
•	The sum of the fares for Urban city type is $ 39,854.38. <br/>
•	The sum of the fares for Suburban city type is $19,356.33. <br/>
•	The sum of the fares for Rural city type is $ 4,327.93. <br/>
•	The average fare per ride for Urban city type is $24.53. <br/>
•	The average fare for Suburban city type is $ 30.97. <br/>
•	The average fare for Rural city type is $ 34.62. <br/>
•	The average fare per driver for Urban city type is $ 16.57 <br/>
•	The average fare per driver for Suburban city type is $ 39.50 <br/>
•	The average fare per driver for Rural city type is $ 55.49. <br/>

2.	The multiple-line graph above shows the total fares for each week by city type. It indicates that ride-sharing company has more total fares and profits in urban cities than in suburban and rural cities. <br/>

 ## `Challenge Overview`
 
 
For the Module 5 Challenge I needed to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Also I needed to submit a written report that created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.  <br/>

## ` Results`


Based on the previous analysis I'd like to propose the following recommendation to V. Isualize:  <br/>
1.	Increase  the average fare in the Urban city type. It may slightly  decrease volume, but also will lead to  opportunity for Urban drivers to expand their range to cover the Suburban and Rural city types. <br/>
2.	Introduce some offers for Suburban cities based on holidays to improve number of rides which eventually will increase total revenue. <br/>
3.	Analyze the demand market in Rural city type. I can assume that the ridesharing needs are high there. But PyBer can’t cover whole market due the lack of drivers (the total number of drivers for Rural city type is 78). I recommend to increase the amount of drivers in Rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand.
